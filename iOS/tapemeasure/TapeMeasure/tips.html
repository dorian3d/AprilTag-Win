Here are some tips on getting accurate measurements:
<ul>
    <li>The app simply measures how far the device has moved. It gives you the straight-line distance from the start point to the end point.
    <li>The app uses the camera to "see" how far the device has moved. It won't work if it's pointed at a blank wall, or a dark area.
    <li>To measure small objects, move the device from one end of the object to the other.
    <li>To measure long distances, hold the device in front of you as you walk.
    <li>Don't move the device too slowly. A normal walking speed is best.
    <li>Hold the device steady with two hands to minimize small vibrations.
    <li>If you have problems, try again with the camera pointed in a different direction.
    <li>There is no limit to how far you can measure with Endless Tape Measure.
</ul>
