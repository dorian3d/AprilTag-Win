Here are some tips on using this app:
<ul>
    <li>Follow the instructions on the screen carefully. Be sure to read everything.
    <li>The app needs to see the object you're measuring from two different locations. That's why it asks you to tap the button, move a little bit, and tap the button again.
    <li>Don't move the device too slowly in between button presses.
    <li>It doesn't matter which direction you move. Right, left, up and down all work equally well. Just choose one direction and go with it.
    <li>Make sure the object you want to measure is in the picture at all times. If you find this difficult, move back a little so the object is further away from you.
    <li>Use the app in well lit areas. It doesn't work well in the dark.
    <li>Hold the device firmly with two hands to minimize small vibrations.
    <li>If you have problems, try again. It can take some practice to get it right.
</ul>
