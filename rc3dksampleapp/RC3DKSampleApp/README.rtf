\f0\fs22 \cf0 This app has the ability to transmit the output from 3DK to a remote computer for visualization purposes. If the RC3DKSampleVis app is running on a machine that is connected to the same wifi network, this app will automatically connect to it via Bonjour. We encourage you to use this visualization tool, as it will give you a much better idea of what 3DK is actually doing.}
