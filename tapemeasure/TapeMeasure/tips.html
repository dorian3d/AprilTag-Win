Here are some tips on getting accurate measurements:
<ul>
    <li>The app simply measures how far the device has moved.
    <li>The app uses the camera to "see" how far the device has moved. The camera must be pointed in a direction where some objects are visible. It won't work if it's pointed at a blank wall, or a dark area.
    <li>To measure small objects, just move the device from one end of the object to the other.
    <li>To measure long distances, hold the device in front of you as you walk. There is no limit to the distance it can measure.
    <li>Don't move the device too slowly. A normal walking speed is best.
    <li>Hold the device steady with two hands to minimize small vibrations.
    <li>If you get an error while measuring, try it again with the camera pointed in a different direction.
</ul>
