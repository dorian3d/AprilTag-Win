 Requests a measured photo from TrueMeasure. The requested API version defaults to the highest version supported by the current SDK.
 You should check getHighestInstalledApiVersion and compare it to the current version (kTMApiVersion) before calling this method.
 The measured photo is sent back via a call to a custom URL scheme implemented by your app.
 The URL scheme must begin with your app's bundle ID, and be followed by ".truemeasure.measuredphoto". So if your app's bundle ID is 
 "com.realitycap.SampleApp", then your custom URL scheme would be "com.realitycap.SampleApp.truemeasure.measuredphoto". 
 See Apple's documentation on custom URL schemes for more info. https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/AdvancedAppTricks/AdvancedAppTricks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH7-SW18

 After the measured photo has been requested, and TrueMeasure has produced it, TrueMeasure will make a call to your custom URL.

 will be passed to your AppDelegate via the method application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:. You must implement that method
 and then pass the URL to this method, along with a pointer to an error object, like so:
 
 - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation
 {
    if ([sourceApplication isEqualToString:kTMTrueMeasureBundleId]) // Make sure the request actually came from TrueMeasure
    {

        {
            // Handle the error. Compare the 'code' property of the error object to values in the TMMeasuredPhotoErrorCode enum.
            return NO;

        if (measuredPhoto) // Make sure the measuredPhoto object is not nil
        {
            // Success. Use the TMMeasuredPhoto object as you will.

 @param url The URL object supplied by application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:.
 @param error A pointer to an NSError variable. Make sure you pass a pointer, like &error. If an error occurs, the 'code' property
 of the error object will correspond to one of the values from the TMMeasuredPhotoErrorCode enum.
 @returns An instance of TMMeasuredPhoto, containing a JPG image and a collection of measured features from the image.
